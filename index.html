Important Disclaimer - There are many Things that I'll never be able to say to your face. also, i'll not verify spelling mistakes/grammer for this letter to make it look more natural.

Dear Jyoti a.k.a. Duddu, Bhalu, Doraemon, Tutiya, Chota Packet, and other several names.

I guess i have already told you this thing before, but, let me say it again XD

I still remember the day when we met for the very first time & I always had a thought looking at you that "Yaar, isko toh pata hi lunga" 😂

not because i was skilled in having relationships, but by observing you personality, it felt so different, friendly and more importantly it sooths my inner self. (or dekha, pata liya na 😂)

But since nobody could change the destiny's plan, we became best friends & I'm glad we are in a good relationship now 😊 
 
You don't realize it much but you really inspire people, I'll tell you how....

Talking about me, you've inspired me in a way no one ever could ! You showed me what's it like to stand up for myself, you taught me how to fight for what I want, you taught me how to take Care of others & their feelings, you taught me how to socialize (seriously) 

& I guess my every victory or experience will forever be empty without you ..... That's how you inspire people 😊

I know we have always been polar opposites since day 1 & we have our differences & debates on opinions & short fights & a list of things that just goes on & on .....

But today I literally wanna let you know that though we are total opposites, I really need a friend like you in my life :")

Because I don't think someone can ever be like you ........we had so many beautiful & funny experiences together & I wish we create more of them too .......

You are the BEST for me that's all I wanna say, because you understand , you believe in me when nobody does, you're too funny & sarcastic, you're talented, you're cute at times & you really care .....

A Very Happy Birthday Girl 👑🎁

I hope our friendship/relationship/tudai always be like this ... & no matter what life brings next, I want you to know that you're stronger, smarter & braver to handle everything in a full classy way!

& don't worry about not being able to take decisions because I know you'll end up where you wanna be & I really believe you will ... apart from that we all have struggle there & its not that easy, so in future too take your time & make right choices 👍.

& even if say for 1% something goes wrong ,know that I'm always there :)

You're beautiful & awesome just remember that 😊😊

Have a great day ahead & party hard & Stay Happy & Stay as you are because you're just Perfect 👌👌

I can really go on till eternity but let's stop here .... ( because I know tera to man kabhi bharega hi nhi, ye sab to 100 baar kholke padhegi 😄)

Forever yours,
Tushar a.k.a. Bubbu ❤️`;
